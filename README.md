DFSIM
=====

DFSIM (Douglas-fir Simulator) is a managed stand growth and yield simulator for coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii). 

It was developed in the 1980s from remeasured plot data contributed by many organizations in the Pacific Northwest. 

It is designed to project the development of stand with at least 80 percent basal area in Douglas-fir and produces yield tables for managed stands with include the effects of initial spacing, precommercial thinning, commercial thinning and fertilization. 

The DFSIM model also contains an economics option that allows users to estimate present net worth of the simulated regime.
